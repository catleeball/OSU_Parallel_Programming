===== Project 4 ======

Array * Array multiply

- Do a for loop non-simd
- Do a SIMD version
  - Supplied example code encompases for loop
- Don't use the intrinsics, use the assembly

- Each core has a SIMD unit
- No setup, just executes it

- Extra credit: combined with threads


===== Project 5 =====

It's project 1 (catapult project) but with GPU and some tweaked numbers

On project site page:

- "Using Linux for this Project"
  - Makefile info for running on rabbit and DGX
  - Use cuda-10.1, some of profs tests don't work on 11.1
  - NVCC works like GCC flags just takes a .cu instead

Threads in a block execute 32 at a time, w.r.t BLOCKSIZEs

Prof prepends "h" and "d" to arrays if it's host or device array


===== Slides: CUDA Matrix Mult =====

2. matrixMult source
   - assume square matrix here, but will work with variable rows/cols
3. CUDA error checking source sample
4. CUDA kern function
   - three for loops A B C


Next week: openCL
